# Prework - *Name of App Here*

Submitted by: **Your Name Here**

**Name of your app** is an app that... [TODO] 

Time spent: 1 hour spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
* Discord
  * Creating custom text channels
  * Deleting messages  
* Pinterest
  * Creating boards for a collection of pictures
  * Organizing boards with files 
* Spotify
  * Creating playlists of songs
  * Sharing playlists with others

App Idea:
An app idea I have in mind would be a personal and social platform for tracking, rating, and discussing video games.
Users could log games they’re currently playing, have completed, put on hold, or dropped. Each game would have a dedicated page with details,
trailers, screenshots, reviews, and related games. You could follow friends to see their activity and compare completion stats.
There could also be custom “playlists” of games that share a similar vibe or style, sort of like Pinterest boards.

## Notes

* Challenges While Building App
  * At first, I was confused how to change the color of the text like how we changed the color of the background but eventually was able to understand how.
